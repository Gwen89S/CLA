# Cloud AI with Azure Machine Learning

![Cloud AI with Azure Machine Learning](./assets/CLA.jpg)

This repository contains all course assignments of my **Cloud AI with Azure Machine Learning** course and will get you up to speed with Microsoft's new Azure Machine Learning Studio environment.

By working through the examples, you will learn how to design, train, and evaluate complex AI pipelines in the cloud without having to type a single line of code. I'll provide you with all the setup instructions and data sets you need to get started.

You will need an Azure account with administrative privileges to complete the examples in this repository.

Please note that this repository only contains walkthroughs with no additional support. 

If you prefer a full-featured e-learning experience with live coaching, please check out my online course here:
